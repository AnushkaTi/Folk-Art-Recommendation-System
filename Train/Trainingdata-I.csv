"Hail Durga, Ma Tara, destroyer of sorrows.
Invincible as the strong southern winds, she is Nagendranandini (daughter of the king of mountains).
As Ma Chandi, her ten arms stretch in ten directions.
Her third eye shines brightly in the middle of her forehead.
Lakshmi, with Saraswati on her left, Kartik and Ganesh
Along with the lion, the Asura, Joya and Bijoya accompany the Mother.

"One day, the goddess Durga bestowed her grace
And revealed a cache of precious gems in a pomegranate grove. 
Kalketu found the treasure under the pomegranate tree
(With this) he cleared the forest named Gujarat and established a town.
Two more pots of gems remained.
Which Kalketu filled into jars.
Sealing them carefully, he carried the jars home
Where the beautiful Khullona (Phullora) waited at the doorway of her thatched hut
For twelve years, the ascetic had been languishing in jail. 
Meanwhile, Khullona had given birth to (their son) Srimonto
Srimonto grew up to be a bright young man
And wished to go out in search of his father.
“You are my only son, the light of my life,” (cried Khullona) 
“If you leave for even a moment, I shall feel abandoned. “
But, if you must go, do pray to Durga.”
On being invoked, Chandi (Durga) appeared
And Khullona handed over Srimonto to the goddess. ","[[[108 133  91]

"Shouting “Hail Durga,” Srimonto boarded the boat
And the boatmen set sail.
They were sailing peacefully over the waters
When at Magora, struck by misfortune, they were caught in a terrible storm. 
(And Srimonto witnessed a strange sight:) A beautiful lady seated on a lotus was swallowing an elephant. 
She was Kamal Kamini (a form of Durga) atop a hundred petalled lotus.
She was the mother of Ganesh, swallowing an elephant.
Srimonto, moved by this wondrous sight
Bowed and offered his salutations a million times.","[[[ 37  50  43]

"Hail Durga, Ma Tara, destroyer of sorrows.
Invincible as the strong southern winds, she is Nagendranandini (daughter of the king of mountains).
As Ma Chandi, her ten arms stretch in ten directions.
Her third eye shines brightly in the middle of her forehead.

"One day, the goddess Durga bestowed her grace
And revealed a cache of precious gems in a pomegranate grove. 
Kalketu found the treasure under the pomegranate tree
(With this) he cleared the forest named Gujarat and established a town.
Two more pots of gems remained.
Which Kalketu filled into jars.
Sealing them carefully, he carried the jars home
Where the beautiful Khullona (Phullora) waited at the doorway of her thatched hut
For twelve years, the ascetic had been languishing in jail. 
Meanwhile, Khullona had given birth to (their son) Srimonto
Srimonto grew up to be a bright young man
And wished to go out in search of his father.

"“You are my only son, the light of my life,” (cried Khullona) 
“If you leave for even a moment, I shall feel abandoned. “
But, if you must go, do pray to Durga.”
On being invoked, Chandi (Durga) appeared
And Khullona handed over Srimonto to the goddess. 
Shouting “Hail Durga,” Srimonto boarded the boat
And the boatmen set sail.
They were sailing peacefully over the waters
When at Magora, struck by misfortune, they were caught in a terrible storm. 
(And Srimonto witnessed a strange sight:) A beautiful lady seated on a lotus was swallowing an elephant. 
She was Kamal Kamini (a form of Durga) atop a hundred petalled lotus.
She was the mother of Ganesh, swallowing an elephant.
Srimonto, moved by this wondrous sight
Bowed and offered his salutations a million times.

Finally, the boat docked at Ratnamala quay to the sound of kettledrums.
Seeing them, the guards and wardens of the kingdom whispered among themselves.
It seemed as if everyone was looting the kingdom 
And the king was kept totally in the dark.

"The king Shalbahon was seated on a jewelled throne. 
Srimonto stood before him with folded hands
And said, “In your kingdom, O king, resides Kamal Kamini. 
“I witnessed this woman swallowing an elephant.”
The king ordered Srimonto to show him this sight.
And promised him half of his kingdom and his daughter’s hand in marriage in return. 
But if Srimonto failed to show him the scene, the king warned 
He would be beheaded at the execution ground in the south. 

The king travelled to Kalidaho to see Kamal Kamini.
But to Srimonto’s embarrassment, the vision did not appear. 
The goddess Bhagoboti stayed hidden among the lotuses.

"Wishing to upset Srimonto, she did not reveal herself.

The enraged king summoned the warden and had Srimonto chained.
Bound in chains and in pain, Srimonto started weeping. 
And as he wept, he invoked Durga
“Oh Shankari,” he cried, “I shall die, but you seem to be unconcerned 
“That your name, Trailokyotarini will be tarnished.”
Chandi, who in the form of a kite, was flying in the sky (heard his prayer). 
She assumed the garb of an aged Brahmin woman and appeared before Srimonto.

His chains fell away from him
And a tearful Srimonto cried out in relief.
With her eighteen arms Mother (Chandi) stood before him at the execution ground. 
“Whose home have you visited, Ma? Who worshipped you?
“My life has become worthwhile, Mother, having seen your eighteen arms.”

Some dance, some sing, while the rest chant (the name of) Hari.
With Radha’s name on their lips, the sakhis roll on the ground in ecstasy.
The lord (Krishna) has dressed his turban with a peacock feather. 
Garlands from the different flowers of Braja adorn his head 
And to the tinkling of cymbals and wooden clappers, a Bakul flower is added atop his head.
On his feet, the Lord has tied anklets.

"Krishna was exchanged at the house of Nanda (for a newborn baby girl). 
(On being hugged by Devaki) the girl began to cry. 
Hearing the cry, Kamsa’s messenger, who knows where he was hiding, instantly appeared at the doorway.
Snatching the child, he hurled her upon a stone.
But slipping from his grasp, young Durga flew up to heaven. 
From the heavenly Himalayas, she spoke. 
“What will you achieve, O hero, by killing me? 
“The one who shall kill you will be Gokul-born.”
Hearing the heavenly prophesy (he) started speaking (crying).

The foolish milkman’s daughter, realizing nothing
Placed (the little) Sri Hari on the demoness’ lap. 
The (baby) Narayana gurgled delightedly 
And started suckling (at her breast), drinking the demoness’ milk. ","[[[ 8 17 24]

"Krishna is filled with remorse.
He commands his flute to turn into a black snake. 
The flute-turned-snake lies in wait on the road.
Curling around her right ankle, it bites Radha’s left ankle.
Radha (in desperation) agrees to whatever Krishna had asked for. 
“The snake has bitten me, save me please,” she cries.
“Tell me truthfully, aunt,“ (says Krishna) “how far has the poison spread?”
“It has spread to every part of my body,” she cries. 
Krishna then, using his divine touch, drives away the poison from her body. 
Rid of the poison, Radha opens her eyes.

"Chand goes to the city of Champaknagar to get his son married there.
Amala, the wife of the merchant of Champaknagar
Has named her daughter Behula—the dancer.
Old man Dannadan is sent off to arrange the match.
Having fixed it up, the childless man died.
Following the wedding, Lakkhindar gets ready to go to the nuptial chamber. 
Bearers took the front and back (of the palanquin) upon their shoulders 
While sweet royal melodies flowed from the Mohan-flute.","[[[ 57  36  17]

"An iron-cast nuptial chamber was built atop Santali hill.
There, Lakhindar, soon fell into a deep sleep. 
Slender as a thread, the snake Kali, sneaked into the room.
Lakkhindar’s beauty made the snake waver. 
Where should I bite this dark and handsome man? 
(But) How would I respond if the gods were to question me? 
With the sun and the moon as its witnesses, it sank its fangs (into Lakkhindar). 
“Wake-up, wake-up merchant Shai’s daughter,” (cried Lakkhindar). 
“Doomed sleep has devoured you, and what devoured me?” 
(She) flung a golden betel nut cracker at the snake
That severed two-and-a-half finger’s length of its tail. 
Writhing in pain, the snake fled. 
Nyara, the servant ran to the trader saying
“Listen O Sir, your son has died.” 
Hearing this news Chand started dancing (in fury).
“Oh, it is good that my boy Lakkhindar has died,” he cried.
Swinging hental staves in both hands, he started dancing.
“How long,” he asks a woman, “for the day to break?”
“Roasted fish I shall eat, along with fermented rice.” 
“You had given me conch shell bangles and saris, (now) take them away (from me).
(And) prepare one banana tree o father- in-law”.
One banana tree was cut into three. 
Upon the raft fastened with bamboo pegs, Behula sailed away.
Floating and drifting, the raft went away. 
(Her) six brothers, in hot pursuit, rushed to meet her.
The brother said, “O dear sister, beloved sister 
“Why are you sailing the waters with that rotten carcass?
“Come back home, we shall look after you. 
“Our six wives shall serve under you.” 
“The house of my parents, o brother, doesn’t suit me anymore.
“One is forever at loggerheads with the sisters-in-law.” 
Having consoled her brothers, she sailed on.
The raft floated up to Gada’s quay. 
Gada doesn’t eat just rice, he catches rui fish (carp) as well.
With swollen legs and a massive hump on his shoulders, Gada 
The one-with-the-fish-hook casts his fishing rod here and there. 
“(Let there be) Ash in your mouth Gada, ash in your mouth.
“I am a servant of mother Manasa, I sail upon these waters.” 
Having cursed Gada, Behula sailed on.

"She sailed avoiding the banks of foxes and dogs.
And many other such banks she went past. 
(Finally) the raft drifted to the quay of Tamluk.
Dhana-Mana—the two boys, were lying on a bed. 
Nitai (Neta), the washerwoman, washed clothes on the river bank of Tamluk.
“The rotting stink spreads about but how can I get rid of it?” (laments Behula).
A white crow has even bitten the head of Lakkhindar.
Two piles of (washed) clothes were put across for drying. 
Behula’s wash was clean and bright. 
Taking the clothes, Behula went to the abode of the gods
And started dancing before Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. 
She pleased the gods with her performance. 
“What boon do you want, Behula, tell me?”
“Resurrect my six brothers-in-law and my husband.” 
“This boon I grant you Behula, I grant you this boon.”
A small white boat she decorated with heartfelt joy 
(And) Behula returned home only when her husband was brought back to life. ","[[[ 31  22  25]

In the morning, the sisters-in-law   discovered that the room was deserted and raised the alarm. Making magical calculations on a chalk grid, Monohar quickly divined that the couple had fled south and instructed his sons to give chase. ","[[[ 29  30  25]

"Meanwhile, Rahuti returned to find Madan missing. It was getting dark so she came up with the idea of seeking work at the king’s court.   

Rahuti, disguised as a man, requested the king for a job. The king replied that there were no jobs left. However, there was an extremely difficult assignment that she could take on: a rhinoceros that was destroying crops in the village needed to be taken down. Would she be able to handle it?  

Rahuti agreed to take on the job and asked to be directed to the location where the rhinoceros had caused damage.  

At the site, she found that the trunk of a palm tree had become very smooth. The reason, she was told, was that the rhinoceros would rub his body daily against this trunk and then proceed to destroy the crops.  

Rahuti asked a woodcutter to cleave the tree half-way through its trunk, and then went and hid, awaiting the rhino. When the rhinoceros arrived and rubbed itself against the trunk, she watched as the tree came crashing down on it, killing it. As a token of proof, Rahuti cut off the dead animal’s tongue.

"Later, some palanquin bearers who were passing by saw the dead rhinoceros. Aware of the king’s promised reward of half his kingdom and the hand of his daughter in marriage, they cut off the animal’s head and produced it triumphantly before the king.  

The king then summoned the young man (Rahuti) who had been given the assignment in the first place. When she claimed that it was she who was the true slayer of the rhinoceros, the king demanded proof.  Rahuti asked the king to examine if the tongue was missing from the rhino’s head. When it was found to be indeed missing, she produced the tongue she had cut off earlier.  

The fraudsters were thrown into prison while Rahuti was offered the promised reward. Rahuti (without revealing her true identity) replied that she would do so after she gave worship to goddess Kali. ","[[[  0  15   6]

Ram released hundreds of arrows at a time.
Volleys of arrows from both warriors tore across the sky. 
Both shot their arrows with all the prowess at their command
Seeing his own (charmed) arrows aimed at himself, Ravana was terrified.
Ram, confident of Ravana’s destruction
Chanted a sacred mantra and released the (divine) arrows 
Two of which pierced Ravana’s heart.
Ravana fell to the ground, writhing in pain

Of Ravana’s one hundred thousand sons and ten million grandsons
Not one remained to continue his lineage.
His fourteen thousand wives wailed around his fallen body
“Who is left to rule the golden kingdom of Lanka now?”
“Oh, my husband,” wept Mandodori, “though you worshipped Shiva
“He deserted you when you were dying!”
Touching each of the ten faces with a torch, Bibhishan lit the pyre.
And plumes of smoke rose from Ravana’s burning pyre.

“There is only one I dread - let him not return to burn our homes. 
“He can reduce Lanka to ashes in the blink of an eye.

While Rama and Sita sat and played a game, Lakshmana stood guard.

Summoning Maricha, Ravana laid out his plan. 
“Go, Maricha to that Panchabati forest 
“You will find Rama, Lakshmana and Sita there 
“When Rama tries to catch you 
“You will cry out ‘my dear brother’ 
Thus, Ravana carefully tutored Maricha. 
Maricha, the sorcerer then assumed the form of a deer. 
How beautiful the deer looked as it danced in myriad ways.   
Chandramukhi called out to her husband, Raghuvar (Rama) 
And pleaded with him. 
Do catch that deer for me and make me happy. 
Then, the both of us, sitting in this forest 
Could forget our sorrows, watching the deer. 
“Come here, brother Lakshmana, I cannot bear (her pain).   
“I am off to catch the deer at Sita’s behest. 
“Until I return to this hut 
“Keep a careful watch over Sita, my brother.” 
With a lusty yell, Rama gave chase to the deer.  
But the deer, (swift as) a golden bee, flew off. 
Catching up with the deer, Rama killed it. 
The deer shrieked out loud  
“I am dying at the hands of a demon, dear brother!  
“Come and save me from my distress!” 
The cries reached Sita’s ears. 
“Come here, brother-in-law Lakshmana, have a betel leaf. 
“You must go search the Dandaka forest for your elder brother.” 
“My brother has ordered me to guard you Lakshmi (Sita). 
“Why do you ask me to leave?” 
“Oh, I understand, Lakshmana, I understand your intentions only too well  
“When my lord (Prabhu) dies, you wish to become my consort.” 
Covering his ears in shame, Lakshmana took Lord Vishnu’s name.  
“You are like my mother, Sumitra and Raghunath, my father! 
“Promise me, O sage’s daughter

"From under the shade of a banyan tree, Ravana then appeared. 
“Give me alms, Ma Janaki so that I can return home
“For I am afraid of your husband’s arrows.”
If he did not receive alms, the hermit (claimed that he) would die. 
Killing a man being a great sin, Sita was scared.
From a golden platter heaped with gems and cowries
The daughter of Janaka poured alms on t the ascetic’s plate.
She stepped across the line to give the alms
And grabbing Sita’s hand, (Ravana) pulle her on to his chariot. 
Up and away the chariot flew
(Till) Jatayu, Dasharatha’s friend, came into view.
(Opening his mouth wide), Jatayu swallowed Ravana’s chariot whole 
And then began a fierce battle between Ravana and Jatayu.
“Take heed, Jatayu, take heed” (Ravana warned) 
“Your friend’s daughter-in-law is in the chariot.
Hearing about his friend’s daughter-in- law, Jatayu was ashamed","[[[ 0  1  0]

"Speaking tenderly, Ramachandra looked at the (dying) bird
And gazed (tearfully) into his precious eyes. 
“Having mortally wounded me, he has taken your wife, Rama 
“Go rescue Sita first, Rama, gem of the Raghus.”

Having heard the news (of Sita’s abduction) from the bird 
Rama lay grief-stricken under a tree.
“We have left our mother behind at home and our father died there. “
As destined by fate, Sita was stolen from the forest.”
Saying this, Ramachandra grieved silently.
Ravana carried off Sita and kept her in the Ashoka grove. 
Habichak, under Chandipur thana is where I live
And singing the Sitaharan pata song for you, I am Jharna Chitrakar.
