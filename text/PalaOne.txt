Victory 
1 In Vedanta philosophy
that which is called brahma, which others consider to be the
primordial male principle, that which is the final destination of the
universe, the lord of cause and dissolution, to that I bow down
100,000 times.

2 Ganapati is the chief of gods.  All poets beginning with Vyasa serve
your feet. You revealed the Agamas and Puranas.  Born from the body
of Girisuta [Parvatl, daughter of the Himalaya Mountains], your body
is short and rotund; you have one tusk and an elephantâ€™s face.  You
are beholden to those who bow to you.  Chase away my obstacles!   I
pray to your feet.  I fall to the earth and with my whole body pay
obeisance to your feet.  Look upon me with your merciful glance.   By
performing devotion to you, the sages obtained liberation and the
cultivation of the four goals of humans.   Your body has the red
radiance of a hibiscus flower, your matted hair falls to the back of
your knees, and the crescent moon adorns your head as a crown.  Gold
anklets make a tinkling sound on your lotus-like feet and your arms
are bedecked with armlets and bracelets.  Your body is decorated with
saffron and you hold a pomegranate in your trunk.  In your hands are a 
trident, club, arrow and noose. You are the son of Siva - your stomach
 is large and your hands reach to your knnes. Whoever remembers you is victorious in battle.
 Garbed in elephant skin you are always reciting mantras. Y
 ou gladden the heart of that daughter of the Himalaya Mountains. I, the Cakravarti Sri Kavikankana,
 sing this before you while begging for devotion to Govinda.
