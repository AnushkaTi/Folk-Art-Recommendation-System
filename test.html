        <td colspan=20><p>There is an urgent need to document the performing art of a class of itinerant
            singing painters from rural West Bengal, India who sing about moral and mythological
            stories painted on scrolls playing the dual role of performers and social entertainers. 
            These scroll painters (also called Patuas, Chitrakars, Patidars or Patikars) walk from 
            village to village unfurling their scrolls to sing their songs, the lyrics and tunes of
            which are composed by themselves or passed down by oral tradition for generations. 
            They paint on small rectangular pieces of paper (called "chauko pata") or long vertical 
            sheets of paper glued together (called "jorano pata") which can sometimes be as long as 
            5-10 meters. The songs are usually written in Bengali with some infiltration of words 
            from the local dialect. This folk art of rural Bengal has been around for a long time 
            (at least since the late 13th century) and the patuas were the chief source of 
            entertainment in the villages -- their art being a combination of story telling, singing and painting.
